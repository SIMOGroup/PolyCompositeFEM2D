# Introduction
We provided a Matlab-based polygonal composite finite elements for 2D solids. 
A computational approach based on arbitrary polygons and a polynomial projection of compatible strain fields through the least-squares approximation. 
For nearly incompressible problems, a pair of projection operators of volumetric and deviatoric strains was established. 
The present formulation satisfies the infâ€“sup stability and improved the accuracy of solutions.
Matlab codes may be extensively developed for a wide range of engineering problems.

Structure of PolyCompositeFEM2D package: 
1. PCEn_CantileverBeam & PCEn_CylinderHollowPlate & PCEn_CooksMembrane: main functions for running 2D solids. 
2. Other functions are given in subfolders. How to run PolyCompositeFEM2D: You need to define input of new problem following code structures. 
3. Run main....m and then use Paraview to show results in displacements and stresses. 
4. Get output
